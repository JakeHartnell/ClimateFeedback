ClimateFeedback
===============

[ClimateFeedback.org](http://climatefeedback.org/) is an effort to 'improve the scientific accuracy in the coverage of climate change and provide readers and authors with in situ feedback from scientists.' In their own words:

> We propose to experiment a novel approach to help Internet users from the general public to key policymakers evaluate how scientifically sound are the claims they read about climate science. A primary goal is to encourage better initial reporting through a consistent, repeated process of collaborative evaluation.

At Ecohack SF we have begun work on sketching out what an implementation of this could look like.

## Hypothes.is Requirements
This will be powered by [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is). It is important that people annotating and moderating the annotations have the right credentials in climate science (PhDs and PhD Candidates). In other words we need to control access to comment. This could come in a number of forms.
* Moderation workflow: anyone can create annotation, but moderators PhDs and PhD candidates can approve them.
* Some form of invite only account creation. This maybe in the form of an authorization code that people need to create an account. The only way to get an authorization code is to email the projects leaders.

##### Profiles
It might be important to show the credentials of the scientists annotating. We should have a talk with them about what information they would like to include in their profile. For example, the profile might contain links to credentials such as published papers, ORCID IDs, Google Schoolar profiles, etc. 

## Frequently Asked Questions
Answers from http://climatefeedback.org/FAQ.html

##### There is a vast amount of information out there, how are you going to select what to evaluate?
We will focus on pieces that play a leading role in shaping the debate around climate change. We will start with a limited number of articles and increase this number as our pool of contributors grows so as to always ensure that we can produce collective contributions of high quality.

##### Who is your intended audience?
Anyone interested in climate science and evidence-based reasoning. We expect our primary audience to be mostly composed of:
* scientists, whether expert in climate or in another field.
* University students.
* Journalists.
* Politicians who care about factual accuracy.
* Activists who want to base their advocacy on scientific ground.

##### Who gets access to comment?

Everyone will be able to see the annotations. Climate Feedback animates a channel of annotations for which contributions are made by active publishers in climate science. It is also possible for anyone to annotate using the public channel of hypothes.is.

##### Scientists are busy people. Will they contribute their time to this project?

Some scientists already devote time to share their expertise by blogging and commenting news article for instance. We will strive to make Climate Feedback an effective way for them to communicate climate science and promote their research and outreach productions. Annotating article also offer the possibility to create small contributions for a small time commitment.

##### How will people be aware of the annotations and actually read them?

We will write short blog posts summarizing scientists findings about the selected articles and invite people to share annotations on social media. Hypothes.is allows to visualize the article with the annotation without installing the web browser add-on, so people will be able to access the annotated article via just one click.

##### How will you avoid annotation to devolve into just another form of the inane argumentation found in most comment sections?

The first part of the answer is to have a group with identified expertise and focus on the 'simple' task of evaluating the factual accuracy of articles. The second part is to have participants respect certain rules that warrant constructive contributions. For instance, participants will be required to back their claims with relevant sources.
